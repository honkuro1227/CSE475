        "    - In class we defined perplexity as `2^(p*log_2(q))`, However the PyTorch cross entropy function uses the natural log. To compute perplexity directly from the cross entropy, you should use `e^p*ln(q)`.\n",

        "4. Which sampling method seemed to generate the best results? Why do you think that is?\n",
        "5. For sampling and beam search, try multiple temperatures between 0 and 2.\n",
        "    - Which produces the best outputs? Best as in made the most sense, your favorite, or funniest, doesn't really matter how you decide.\n",
        "    - What does a temperature of 0 do? What does a temperature of 0<temp<1 do? What does a temperature of 1 do? What does a temperature of above 1 do? What would a negative temperature do (assuming the code allowed for negative temperature)?\n",
